  <Step title="Link Your Roblox Account">
    If you didn't sign up with Roblox OAuth, you'll need to link your account:

    1. **Navigate to Profile Settings** in your dashboard
    2. **Click "Link Roblox Account"**
    3. **Enter your exact Roblox username** (case-sensitive)
    4. **Check your Roblox messages** for verification code
    5. **Reply with the verification code**
    6. **Return to Bloxora** and confirm verification

    <Warning>
      Make sure your Roblox privacy settings allow messages from other users, or you won't receive the verification code.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your Workspace">
    Set up your first workspace for your Roblox group:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Required Information
    - Workspace Name: "Your Group Name"
    - Roblox Group ID: 12345678
    - Description: Brief group description
    - Timezone: Your primary timezone
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    **Finding Your Roblox Group ID:**
    1. Visit your group page on Roblox
    2. Check the URL: `roblox.com/groups/[GROUP_ID]/[group-name]`
    3. The number after `/groups/` is your Group ID
